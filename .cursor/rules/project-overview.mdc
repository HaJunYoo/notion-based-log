# Project Overview

This is **morethan-log**, a Next.js static blog that uses Notion as a Content Management System (CMS). The blog supports both standard blog posts and full pages (like resumes), with automatic content synchronization from Notion.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js 13** with Pages Router (not App Router)
- **TypeScript** - All new code must be typed
- **Emotion** - CSS-in-JS styling (use styled components)
- **React Query** (`@tanstack/react-query`) - Data fetching and caching
- **Notion API** - Content management via custom notion-client

## File Structure
```

├── pages/           # Next.js pages and API routes

## Essential Commands
- `yarn dev` - Start development server on http://localhost:3000
- `yarn build` - Build for production
- `yarn start` - Start production server
- `yarn lint` - Run ESLint (always run after making changes)
- `yarn postbuild` - Generate sitemap (runs automatically after build)

## Before Making Changes
1. Always run `yarn dev` to start the development server
2. Test your changes locally before committing
3. Run `yarn lint` to ensure code quality
4. Run `yarn build` to verify production build works
